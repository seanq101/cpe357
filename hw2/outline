HW2 Decomposition

Problem Statement -
Write a program that will return a sorted list of the n most common words in a file or set of
files, sorted by order of frequency.

Logic of the Program -
Parse Command Line Arguments and find out how many (k) words should be output
Verify Command Line Arguments
Read input character by character(getchar), adding words(defined by whitespace predecing or trailing a set of characters) to a HashTable
Print out the top "k" words out of all unique words in the file

Data Structures -
Hash table used to store all unique words(with their frequency stored along with the word)

Algorithms -
Quicksort (nlogn) to sort the table by frequencies

Methods -
checkArguments(int argc, char *argv)
initTable()
fillTable()
sortTable()
printTopFrequencies(int num)

Testing
checkArguments
	Test: unit tests with specified arrays of strings, or system tests by echoing user input
initTable
	Test: unit tests to verify it is a blank table of predetermined length
fillTable
	Test: system tests with correct and erroneous input, diff myfw output with instructor's fw output
sortTable
	Test: system tests with correct and erroneous input, diff myfw output with instructor's fw output
printTopFrequencies(int num)
	Test: system tests with correct and erroneous input, diff myfw output with instructor's fw output
