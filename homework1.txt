Problem Statement:
	Implement a (feature-reduced) version of the Unix tr program. This program “translates” characters
	based on a user-specified mapping. 

Data Structures:
	Array of ints representing the new mapping as defined by the argument sets.

Parse command-line arguments
	Test: unit tests with specified arrays of strings, or system tests by echoing user input
Verify command-line arguments
 	Test: unit tests with specified arrays of strings or, system tests by echoing user input
Simplify sets by reducing escape sequences to single characters.
	- Translate characters in the sets to their ASCII value to ensure correctness
 	Test: unit tests on various string arguments
Read/write input character-by-character (getchar/putchar)
	– Translate according to mapping defined by sets, if translate mode.
	– Remove characters listed in set, if delete mode.
	Test: system tests with correct and erroneous input, diff mytr output with tr output
